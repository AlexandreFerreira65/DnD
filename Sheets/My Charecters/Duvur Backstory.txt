- Grandmother (Nasri Marbleshield) was an adventurer that started has a fighter, but after saving a brasss dragon, as a tanhking gift bestowed apon my grandmother magical powers.

- She and her party went on to become great adventures, and she gained renow and wealth for the Marbleshield family making it a notable and respectfull family off Masons and Carpenters.

- Some day she had return home, from on of it's adventures, with a baby boy in her arms not wanting to reveal the identety of it's father, that she named Darron, the boy grew up in the family mansion hearing with wide-eyes the stories of his mother, although it didin't showed any signs of the powers hes mother had, he had the wish to become a great adventurer just like her.

- When the Darron was 20 and was strating on going in the firs't adventures of his own, his mother died defending the Sword Coast region from a great perril, it was a great tragedy but she had died a heroen and many people would remember the great name of Nasri Marbleshield. 

- The boy was devastated but he knew that his mother had died doing the right thing and if he wanted to keep his mother legacy alive he knew he had to be strong.

- The other great familys of Waterdeep out of respect supported the Marbleshields at first, but after a few years, the social position of the family within the city started to steadily decline.

- The young son after seeing this decided to take on Adventuring again hoping that, has his mother did, to accomplish great deeds and once again bring Renew and Power to the Marbleshild Family.

- The journey was bumpy and with much more obstacles and dangers than he first expected, but after a difficult first few years, he was finally getting successful, starting again to bring fame to the Marbleshield name.

- During these years he also found love, at the hands of another Dwarf named Tasnora that was in his party. After a while, she moved to the Marbleshild mansion had a son named Duvur, and went on many adventures together.

-Until one day, when Duvur was just 6 years old, disaster struck the Marbleshield family again. And some standard quest that his parents were in somehow went terribly bad, what was left of the fight scene was a bloody mess where not all party members could be identified but they were all presumed dead. 

- Duvur was from that point one raised by his uncle and aunt that although skilled mason workers add no skill or interest in adventuring. And the bussiness was now once again strungling so they haden't much time to raise him either.

- And while he grew hearing the stories of his parents and his grandmother and what had happened to them, becuse of their abscense he started them and their life choices.

- For leaving their family to go on some silly adventures just to get themselves killed leaving the rest of the family behind. Since then Duvur always looked to adventures and all that they stood for with a look of disdain.

- And even when he started to show sins of inheriting his grandmother's powers, and being somewhat incentivized by his family to once again take on the adventuring life, Duvur looked at his powers more as a curse than a gift.

- But he also had to learn to control his powers, because surges of energy comed sometimes and he didn't know how to control them which could mean danger for himself and others around him.

- But besides that basic training, Duvur chose to ignore his powers, determined to bring the Marbleshield name fame not with adventures but with honest work and good craftsmanship.

- Until one that Duvur heard that his father/mother might still be alive somewhere and chose to try looking for them.
